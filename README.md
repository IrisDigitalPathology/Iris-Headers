# Iris-Headers

This repository contains the Iris Digital Pathology public header files for all available modules(*see below*). These headers are not exhaustive; rather they allow for integration of the simplified public Iris API without defining the internal stuctures within each module. These are the preferred headers if you wish to use Iris without compiling Iris modules individually.
